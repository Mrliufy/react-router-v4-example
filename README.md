# React Router v4 sample

A very simple React application that shows how to use the new `React Router v4`, which is a complete rewrite from previous versions, since it is based on the philosophy of 'dynamic routing' or 'no configuration' (you will notice that the routes are components themselves).

On this app, to use some sample data, I am displaying some of the championships won by River Plate since 2010 (a soccer team from Argentina), and a schedule of upcoming matches in 2017.
